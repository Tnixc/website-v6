Every week I had two quizzes and one assignment, and I would usually only spend 2–3 hours studying for them the day before. Not skipping almost all lectures helped. My average for this term was >90%, and although I did not properly set academic expectations for myself<sup class=footnote-ref><a data-footnote-ref href=#fn-5 id=fnref-5>5</a></sup>, this was higher than I expected.<p>For midterms, I spent about 3–4 hours on each math course, and not much else on the other subjects. For finals, it was roughly 4–12 hours for each subject, again, more math heavy. I can't say this was particularly difficult to pull off, and having a study partner definitely helped.<p>The effort required for <code>CS</code>, <code>ECON</code>, and <code>COMMST</code> was negligible.<p>The course content was neither interesting nor boring, I did learn a lot of new content, certainly much more compared to high school. I much prefer the higher density and pacing. The weekly quizzes made sure I was caught up as well.<p>One thing I appreciate is that my math profs are pretty great. They wrote the course notes/textbooks, which were free, and it matched the lectures one-to-one. There was always someone online to answer your questions on the forums too. Unfortunately for <code>MATH135</code> the practice problems did not come with solutions. I (and many others) disagree with this decision. You can view a somewhat funny exchange regarding this <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/1ot17mk/comment/no3y2e8/>here</a>.<hr><p>I'm currently studying math and I must say I have some doubts as to whether this is the optimal path for me. I believe having a high interest in your course content is essential, and I certainly don't dislike math but I don't feel this excitement so much either.<p>Also worth noting that I do not care about how practical (or not) what I'm learning is. Many paths are open, but they all come with tradeoffs and looking around is difficult.<p>I've been leaning towards <a href=https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/combinatorics-and-optimization>Combinatorics & Optimization</a> or <a href=https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/computational-mathematics>Computational Mathematics</a>. It would also be wonderful if I enjoyed <code>STAT230</code> (which I am taking next term) and went towards Data science or Statistics since I believe that would be more employable but it's not looking likely.<hr><p>Aside from schoolwork, I also played a lot of pool, met some cool people, and went to a few events. I wish I had gone out even more, and connected with even more people, but it is what it is. Next term I hope to "do better". How exactly will I do this? I don't know... should probably figure that out.<p>I've come a long way from when I actively avoided social situations, to now where I actually enjoy them. Regardless, it still takes effort to put yourself in those situations.<p>UWaterloo has the reputation that it is horrible for socializing, and indeed I can see aspects of this, but I don't have a baseline to compare it against, so I can't comment on this much. I think there are places you can put yourself; perchance it does not come as naturally compared to other universities.<p>After all, socializing is all about maximizing your surface area, and you can certainly do so.<p>One thing I regret is not purchasing the climbing gym membership during the term, it's a good deal<sup class=footnote-ref><a data-footnote-ref href=#fn-6 id=fnref-6>6</a></sup> and I think I would've greatly enjoyed it. Next term I will be climbing at least two times per week at the PAC<sup class=footnote-ref><a data-footnote-ref href=#fn-7 id=fnref-7>7</a></sup>.<hr><p>I've also had more free time than I expected, and I spent much of that working on <a href=https://github.com/tnixc/volette>my compiler</a> and other recreational programming projects<sup class=footnote-ref><a data-footnote-ref href=#fn-8 id=fnref-8>8</a></sup>. It's been very fun, and I'm grateful that I'm not an engineering student and that I have the time to do this. Another thing I did was that I played Silksong (up to Act 2), which was a delightful experience. Aside from that I didn't play any games at all.<p>I also lived with a roommate this term, and it was alright. We didn't speak much, and unfortunately we had rather mismatched sleep schedules, and both of us had wild swings. Sometimes I went to sleep at 9 and other times at 2, all in the span of a week. Usually I went to sleep earlier. I don't think it was bad, but I'm grateful that I'll get the room to myself next term.<p>Oh and the common bathrooms were amazingly clean, which was a welcome surprise.<p>Another goal I had was to eat more. Now, you'd think this would be easy considering that I had an all-you-can-eat meal plan. This was, in fact, not the case, as I lost 1 kg over the semester and I am already severely underweight. I partly blame this on the cafeteria's less-than-satisfactory hours and partly on the fact that I will just be too lazy eat, or wake up too late (same thing). Having a small appetite also doesn't help.<hr><p>My course-load will be significantly heavier next term and so it's not looking like I will have a lot of free time next term, but that remains to be seen. Not only that, but I'll also be searching for coop jobs, which is a whole other ordeal in itself. (please hire me)<p>Even though university was a totally fresh experience, these 4 months have really flown by. It's interesting to think that 1/8th of my study terms are over. One down, seven to go.<hr><h6><em>thanks for reading! very minimal AI used! all handwritten</em></h6><hr><section class=footnotes data-footnotes><ol><li id=fn-1><p><code>MATH135</code>: <strong>Algebra for Honours Mathematics</strong>, <code>MATH137</code>: <strong>Calculus 1 for Honours Mathematics</strong> <a aria-label="Back to reference 1" class=footnote-backref data-footnote-backref data-footnote-backref-idx=1 href=#fnref-1>↩</a></p><li id=fn-2><p><code>CS135</code>: <strong>Designing Functional Programs</strong>—Basically intro to programming but it was in <a href=https://racket-lang.org/>Racket</a>.
