You can find all of my projects on my [github](https://github.com/tnixc). I've mostly been building rust clis, web apps, and whatever I happen to find interesting.

---

Here's a list of notable projects:
- [Zcore](https://github.com/tnixc/zcore) - An assembly parser and cpu emulator written in zig. Wip.
- [Simple](https://github.com/tnixc/simple) - A *simple* static site generator/component based html inliner written in rust. I wrote it to build this website. Very buggy, but it has cool features like bi-directional editing.
- [Replacer](https://github.com/tnixc/replacer) - A cli to replace text recursively in files or from stdin to stdout. Written in rust, of course.
- [lightscrape-rs](https://github.com/tnixc/lightscrape-rs) - A cli to asynchronously download lightnovels from certain websites, and compile them into an epub. 
- [Toki](https://github.com/tnixc/toki) - A macOS app usage tracking app written in swift. Wip.
- [osu-radio](https://github.com/team-btmc/osu-radio) - A music player for playing songs from your osu! library. I'm a major contributor and designer.
- [edo](https://github.com/tnixc/edo) - A colorscheme I created and use. It's a mix of tokyonight and catppuccin. All the ports are made with replacing hex codes from catppuccin's ports.
- [nix-config](https://github.com/tnixc/nix-config) - My nix-darwin configuration. I spend way too much time on this.
- [tnixc.space](https://github.com/tnixc/website-v6) - This website. This is version 6.1 and all the previous versions are also on github." style="display: contents;"><h1>projects</h1><p>You can find all of my projects on my <a href=https://github.com/tnixc>github</a>.
