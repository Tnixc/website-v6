## Going outside

I love travelling. Some of my favourite places are **Hokkaido**, **The Netherlands**, and **Switzerland**. I enjoy hiking, cycling, and trying out new foods.

## Uses

My daily driver is **macOS** on an M3 air, and I use **Nix** for package management. I'm a big fan of **Neovim** for editing but also use Zed and VS Code. I use a tiling window manager, and now I can't live without it. As for hardware, I'm pretty entrenched in the apple ecosystem. You can see the software I use [here](./content/software_i_use.html).

## Programming

I like working with **Rust**, I'm interested in systems programming, compilers, and functional programming. I also write a lot of random CLI tools.

## Robots & FRC

I've been involved with **FIRST Robotics Competition** since 2022. I've only spent 2 seasons with a team, but I've enjoyed it immensely.

## Design Interests

### UI Design

I love detailed, functional interfaces with thoughtful micro-interactions. I spend a lot of time thinking about UI.

### Drawing & Digital Art

I draw digitally using **Procreate** and do 3D art with **Blender**.

### Typography

I'm a type nerd who enjoys exploring different typefaces and their applications. Current favorites are **Zodiak** and **Berkeley Mono**. SF Pro is also the goat.

## Other Passions

### Mechanical Keyboards

I'm into custom mechanical keyboards with a preference for **linear switches** and I've been trying out the **Semimak** layout.

### Coffee

I love coffee. Hot coffee though.

### Books & Anime

I read a lot of webnovels and other fiction. Current favourite is **Lord of the Mysteries**. I also watch anime, occasionally.

### Knowledge Management

I've jumped around Obsidian, Apple Notes, Notion, and now I'm using **Craft** for knowledge management. It's available everywhere, has a student plan, and beautifully designed. I use the **Zettelkasten** method, and **grep** for what I need all the time.

### Arcade & Video Games

I play all kinds of games, mainly rhythm games, roguelites, and RPGs. *Minecraft / osu! / maimai DX / Wacca / DDR / Hades / Celeste / Hollow Knight / Divinity 2* are some of my favorites." style="display: contents;"><h1>About</h1><h2>Going outside</h2><p>I love travelling.
