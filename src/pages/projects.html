# Projects

You can find all of my projects on my [github](https://github.com/tnixc).

Here's a list of notable projects:

[âœ¦ Volette](https://github.com/tnixc/volette) - A work in progress compiler for an expression oriented language I designed, written in rust. Cranelift backend.

[Simple](https://github.com/tnixc/simple) - A static site generator/component based html inliner written in rust. It has cool features like bi-directional editing.

[Cazal](https://github.com/tnixc/cazal) - Tiny stack based interpreted programming language in C.

[Replacer](https://github.com/tnixc/replacer) - A cli to replace text recursively in files or from stdin to stdout. Written in rust.

[3db](https://github.com/tnixc/3db) - A UI for using GitHub repositories as a CDN/file store. Pretty flaky, but works. Uses supabase and sveltekit.

[This website](https://github.com/tnixc/website-v6) - This is v7, v6 was built with Simple. You can read more about the history of this site [here](./content/history.html).

[nix-config](https://github.com/tnixc/nix-config) - My nix-darwin configuration. I spend way too much time on this.

[lightscrape-rs](https://github.com/tnixc/lightscrape-rs) - A cli to asynchronously download lightnovels from certain websites, and compile them into an epub.

[Toki](https://github.com/tnixc/toki) - A macOS app usage tracking app written in swift.
