# projects

You can find all of my projects on my [github](https://github.com/tnixc). I've mostly been building rust clis, web apps, and whatever I happen to find interesting.

---

Here's a list of notable projects:
- [ Zcore ](https://github.com/tnixc/zcore) - An assembly parser and cpu emulator written in zig. Wip.
- [ Simple ](https://github.com/tnixc/simple) - A *simple* static site generator/component based html inliner written in rust. I wrote it to build this website. Very buggy, but it has cool features like bi-directional editing.
- [ Replacer ](https://github.com/tnixc/replacer) - A cli to replace text recursively in files or from stdin to stdout. Written in rust, of course.
- [ lightscrape-rs ](https://github.com/tnixc/lightscrape-rs) - A cli to asynchronously download lightnovels from certain websites, and compile them into an epub. 
- [ Toki ](https://github.com/tnixc/toki) - A macOS app usage tracking app written in swift. Wip.
- [ osu-radio ](https://github.com/team-btmc/osu-radio) - A music player for playing songs from your osu! library. I'm a major contributor and designer.
- [ edo ](https://github.com/tnixc/edo) - A colorscheme I created and use. It's a mix of tokyonight and catppuccin. All the ports are made with replacing hex codes from catppuccin's ports.
- [ nix-config ](https://github.com/tnixc/nix-config) - My nix-darwin configuration. I spend way too much time on this.
- [ tnixc.space ](https://github.com/tnixc/website-v6) - This website. This is version 6.1 and all the previous versions are also on github.
