# About

### Going outside

I love travelling. Some of my favourite places are **Hokkaido**, **The Netherlands**, and **Switzerland**. I enjoy hiking, cycling, and trying out new foods.

### Uses

My daily driver is **macOS** on an M3 air, and I use **Nix** for package management. I'm a big fan of **Neovim** for editing but also use Zed and VS Code. I use a tiling window manager, and now I can't live without it. As for hardware, I'm pretty entrenched in the apple ecosystem. You can see the software I use [here](./content/software_i_use.html).

### Programming

I like working with **Rust**, I'm interested in systems programming, compilers, and functional programming. I also write a lot of random CLI tools. I'm also looking to learn more about ocaml, haskell, etc. I've really been enjoying racket as a part of my CS course lately as well.

### Robots & FRC

I've been involved with *FIRST Robotics Competition* since 2022. I've only spent 2 seasons with a team, but I've enjoyed it immensely.

### Typography

I enjoy exploring different typefaces and their applications. Current favorites are **Zodiak** and **Berkeley Mono**. SF Pro is also great, as well as Anthropic Sans and Serif. Best reading font remains **New York Small**.

### Reading & Books & Anime

I really enjoy Ted Chiang's works. I also read various blog posts a fair bit, including *Construction Physics, Astral Codex Ten, Dan Lu*. Aside from that, I read a lot of webnovels and other fiction. Current favourite is *Lord of the Mysteries*. I also watch anime, occasionally.

### Arcade & Video Games

I rarely play video games now, but I play all kinds of games, mainly rhythm games, roguelites, and RPGs. *Minecraft, osu!, maimai DX, Wacca, DDR, Hades, Celeste(a lot), Hollow Knight, Silksong, Divinity 2* are some of my favorites.

### Other stuff I like
