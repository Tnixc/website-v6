This site is entirely static, just good old html files.

In designing this site, I realized that I unintentionally copied [ryanccn's website](https://ryanccn.dev/)'s layout. It's just the best layout I guess?

This site's aesthetic was also inspired by [Commit Mono's website](https://commitmono.com/), [0x57](https://www.0x57.dev/), and [sora.sh](https://sora.sh).

You can view the source code [here](https://github.com/tnixc/website-v6).

You can view page analytics [here](https://cloud.umami.is/share/o4Mje48LZ8anrxZi/tnixc.space). They are 100% anonymous.
