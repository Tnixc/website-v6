Hello! I'm a grade 12 highschool student from Hong Kong studing in Canada. I spend most of my time programming, reading, and watching anime. I draw sometimes as well. I want to learn a lot of things.

# Work

I usually work with web technologies, but I've been doing a lot of stuff in rust recently too. The languages I'm most familiar are **Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python**. I use plenty of HTML/CSS too, and I have some domain specific experience with Java as well. I'm also looking to learning Go, Nix, and Zig in the future.

I've used **Vue, Nuxt, Svelte, Astro**, and I would say I'm most familiar with Vue. And I'm never using react if I don't have to.

I care deeply about UI, and I'd say design engineering is one of the roles I relate to the most.

# Tools

I also work with a lot of tools. I use **Zed** (with vim mode enabled of course) as my primary editor. I'm also familiar with Figma, and I'm learning to use Blender. I also use a mix of apple reminders and notes, and mainly obsidian for note taking.

For hardware, I run a *13" M3 MacBook Air*, and a custom built PC(which I'm planning to switch to NixOS soon??). I'm pretty deep into the apple ecosystem, I've got an iPad for drawing and an iPhone and watch as well.

# Hobbies

I don't play a lot of video games anymore (I enjoy programming more), but I used to be pretty into osu! and Minecraft. I've also enjoyed *Cyberpunk 2077, Divinity 2 Original Sin, Celeste, project sekai, and Hades*. I'm looking forward to playing Baldur's Gate 3 and Elden Ring at the moment. I also like arcade rhythm games like maimai DX and Wacca.

I also listen to a lot of music. I like a lot of genres, but I mainly listen to J-Pop. Recently I've been listening to *Mili and Eve. Vocaloid, Laufey, breakcore, Porter Robinson, Madeon, and lots of game OSTs* also get a lot of playtime.

Lastly, I also contribute to [[catppuccin]](https://github.com/catppuccin) sometimes, and I hang out on its discord server.
