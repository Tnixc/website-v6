##### he/him â€¢ EST

I'm a 17 year old undergraduate student studying mathematics at the **University of Waterloo** from *Hong Kong* studying in *Canada*. I'd like to major in [computational mathematics](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/computational-mathematics). I go by Tnixc online.

I love programming and design. You can learn more about me on [about](./about.html).

# Work

I now mostly work with **Rust**. I love compilers, language design, type theory, and performance engineering.

I've also worked with **JavaScript & TypeScript**, *Java*, *Python* and other web development languages with frameworks such as *Vue*, *Svelte*, *Solid*.

You can view [my projects](./projects.html) on my [GitHub](https://github.com/tnixc).
