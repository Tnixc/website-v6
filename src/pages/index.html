Hello! I'm a **grade 12 high school student from *Hong Kong* studying in Canada.** I spend most of my time programming, reading, and watching anime. I draw sometimes as well. I want to learn a lot of things. I also like hiking, biking (in 5-15C slightly cloudy weather).

# Work

I usually work with web technologies, but I've been doing a lot of stuff in Rust recently too. The languages I'm most familiar with are **Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript**. I use plenty of *HTML/CSS* too, and I have some domain-specific experience with *Java, python, and swift(with swiftUI)* as well. I'm also looking to learn Go, Nix, and Zig in the future.

I've used **Vue, Nuxt, Svelte, Astro**, and I would say I'm most familiar with Vue. And I'm never using React if I don't have to.

I care deeply about UI, and I'd say design engineering is one of the roles I relate to the most.

# Tools

I also work with a lot of tools. I use Neovim, Zed, and Xcode(if I have to) as my primary editor. I'm also familiar with Figma, and I'm learning to use Blender. I use a mix of Apple Reminders and Notes, and mainly Obsidian for note-taking. Raycast is also a must.

For hardware, I run a *13" M3 MacBook Air* and a custom-built PC. I'm pretty deep into the Apple ecosystem, as I've got an iPad for drawing, and an iPhone and Watch as well.

# Hobbies

I don't play a lot of video games anymore (I enjoy programming more), but I used to be pretty into *osu! and Minecraft.* I've also enjoyed *Cyberpunk 2077, Divinity 2 Original Sin, Celeste, Project Sekai, and Hades*. I'm looking forward to playing Baldur's Gate 3 and Elden Ring. I also like arcade rhythm games like *maimai DX and Wacca*.

I also listen to a lot of music. I like many genres, but I mainly listen to J-Pop. Recently, I've been mainly listening to *Mili and Eve. Vocaloid, Laufey, breakcore, Porter Robinson, Madeon, and lots of game OSTs* also get a lot of playtime.

Lastly, I also contribute to [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) sometimes, and I just spend most of my time coding.
