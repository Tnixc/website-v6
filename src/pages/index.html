Hello! I'm a **grade 12 high school student from *Hong Kong* studying in Canada.** I spend most of my time programming, reading, and watching anime. I draw sometimes as well. I want to learn a lot of things. I also like hiking and biking in nature.

# Work

I usually work with web technologies, but I've been doing a lot of stuff in Rust recently too. The languages I'm most familiar with are **Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript**. I use plenty of *HTML/CSS* too, and I have some domain-specific experience with *Java and swift(and swiftUI)* as well. I'm also looking to learn Go, Nix, and Zig in the future.

I've used **Vue, Nuxt, Svelte, Astro, and Solid**, and I would say I'm most familiar with Vue. I'm never using React if I don't have to.
I care deeply about design and UI, and I'd say design engineering is one of the roles I relate to the most.
# Tools

I use Neovim, Zed, and Xcode(if I have to) as my primary editor. I'm also familiar with Figma, and I'm learning to use Blender. For hardware, I run a *13" M3 MacBook Air* and a PC I don't use that much.

# Hobbies

I don't play a lot of video games anymore (I enjoy programming more), but I used to be pretty into *osu! and Minecraft.* I've also enjoyed *Cyberpunk 2077, Divinity 2 Original Sin, Celeste, Project Sekai, and Hades*. I'm looking forward to playing Baldur's Gate 3 and Elden Ring. I also like arcade rhythm games like *maimai DX and Wacca*.

I listen to a lot of music. I like many genres, but I mainly listen to Pop and J-Pop. Recently, I've been mainly listening to *The weekend* a lot. *Eve, Vocaloid, breakcore, artcore(Sakuzyo), Porter Robinson*, and a lot of *game OSTs* also get a lot of playtime.

Recently I've also been reading [near's reading list](https://near.blog/links/) and I've been enjoying it greatly. Lastly, I also contribute to [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) sometimes, part of the [←](https://ctp-webr.ing/tnixc/previous) [webring](https://ctp-webr.ing/) [→](https://ctp-webr.ing/tnixc/next), and its discord is where I hang out most.
