I took `MATH135 & 137` [^1], `CS135` [^2], `COMMST100` [^3] for my required communications course, and `ECON101` [^4] for my elective.

Regarding grades, I was quite surprised by my efficiency. Every week I had two quizzes and one assignment, and I would usually only spend 2–3 hours studying for them the day before. Not skipping almost all lectures helped. My average for this term was >90%, and although I did not properly set academic expectations for myself[^5], this was higher than I expected.

For midterms, I spent about 3–4 hours on each math course, and not much else on the other subjects. For finals, it was roughly 4–12 hours for each subject, again, more math heavy.
I can't say this was particularly difficult to pull off, and having a study partner definitely helped.

The effort required for `CS`, `ECON`, and `COMMST` was negligible.

The course content was neither interesting nor boring, I did learn a lot of new content, certainly much more compared to high school. I much prefer the higher density and pacing. The weekly quizzes made sure I was caught up as well.

One thing I appreciate is that my math profs are pretty great. They wrote the course notes/textbooks, which were free, and it matched the lectures one-to-one. There was always someone online to answer your questions on the forums too. Unfortunately for `MATH135` the practice problems did not come with solutions. I (and many others) disagree with this decision. You can view a somewhat funny exchange regarding this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/1ot17mk/comment/no3y2e8/).

I'm currently studying math and I must say I have some doubts as to whether this is the optimal path for me. I believe having a high interest in your course content is essential, and I certainly don't dislike math but I don't feel this excitement so much either.

Also worth noting that I do not care about how practical (or not) what I'm learning is. Many paths are open, but they all come with tradeoffs and looking around is difficult.

I've been leaning towards [Combinatorics & Optimization](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/combinatorics-and-optimization) or [Computational Mathematics](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/computational-mathematics). It would also be wonderful if I enjoyed `STAT230` (which I am taking next term) and went towards Data science or Statistics since I believe that would be more employable but it's not looking likely.

Aside from schoolwork, I also played a lot of pool, met some cool people, and went to a few events. I wish I had gone out even more, and connected with even more people, but it is what it is. Next term I hope to "do better". How exactly will I do this? I don't know... should probably figure that out.

I've come a long way from when I actively avoided social situations, to now where I actually enjoy them. Regardless, it still takes effort to put yourself in those situations.

UWaterloo has the reputation that it is horrible for socializing, and indeed I can see aspects of this, but I don't have a baseline to compare it against, so I can't comment on this much. I think there are places you can put yourself; perchance it does not come as naturally compared to other universities.

After all, socializing is all about maximizing your surface area, and you can certainly do so.

One thing I regret is not purchasing the climbing gym membership during the term, it's a good deal[^6] and I think I would've greatly enjoyed it. Next term I will be climbing at least two times per week at the PAC[^7].

I've also had more free time than I expected, and I spent much of that working on [my compiler](https://github.com/tnixc/volette) and other recreational programming projects[^8]. It's been very fun, and I'm grateful that I'm not an engineering student and that I have the time to do this. Another thing I did was that I played Silksong (up to Act 2), which was a delightful experience. Aside from that I didn't play any games at all.

I also lived with a roommate this term, and it was alright. We didn't speak much, and unfortunately we had rather mismatched sleep schedules, and both of us had wild swings. Sometimes I went to sleep at 9 and other times at 2, all in the span of a week. Usually I went to sleep earlier. I don't think it was bad, but I'm grateful that I'll get the room to myself next term.

Oh and the common bathrooms were amazingly clean, which was a welcome surprise.

Another goal I had was to eat more. Now, you'd think this would be easy considering that I had an all-you-can-eat meal plan. This was, in fact, not the case, as I lost 1 kg over the semester and I am already severely underweight. I partly blame this on the cafeteria's less-than-satisfactory hours and partly on the fact that I will just be too lazy eat, or wake up too late (same thing). Having a small appetite also doesn't help.

My course-load will be significantly heavier next term and so it's not looking like I will have a lot of free time next term, but that remains to be seen. Not only that, but I'll also be searching for coop jobs, which is a whole other ordeal in itself. (please hire me)

Even though university was a totally fresh experience, these 4 months have really flown by. It's interesting to think that 1/8th of my study terms are over. One down, seven to go.

[^1]: `MATH135`: **Algebra for Honours Mathematics**, `MATH137`: **Calculus 1 for Honours Mathematics**

[^2]: `CS135`: **Designing Functional Programs**—Basically intro to programming but it was in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/). I love functional programming, really enjoyable.

[^3]: `COMMST100`: **Interpersonal Communication**—Not as bad as it sounds. Work consisted of one presentation and some other negligible busywork

[^4]: `ECON101`: **Introduction to Microeconomics**—Stuff I already knew from high school.

[^5]: I gotta fix this fr, but i got fear of failure and commitment issues etc

[^6]: CAD $82.00 +HST, with rental shoes. For the whole 4 months!

[^7]: The _Physical Activities Complex_, UWaterloo's gym. It's on campus and a 2 minute walk from my residence.

[^8]: These include _in swift_: a [macOS resource monitor](https://github.com/Tnixc/nano-stats), a [PDF organization app](https://github.com/Tnixc/collect). _Go_: an [apple reminders dashboard](https://github.com/Tnixc/reminders-dashboard). And worked a bit with [a GLSL 4.6 to Metal translation layer in C/C++](https://github.com/Tnixc/MGL). Also did [Advent of Code 2025 in OCaml](https://github.com/Tnixc/Advent-of-Code/tree/main/2025), which was super fun.
