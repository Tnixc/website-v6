# Software I use

Here's a comprehensive list of the software I use daily on macOS.

## Development

**Editor**: I primarily use Neovim for most of my coding, but I also use Zed for larger projects and VS Code when I need specific extensions.

**Terminal**: I use Alacritty as my terminal emulator with zsh and oh-my-zsh for shell configuration.

**Package Management**: Nix via nix-darwin for system-level packages, and language-specific package managers for projects.

**Version Control**: Git with GitHub CLI for repository management.

## Design & Creative

**Vector Graphics**: I use Figma for UI/UX design and prototyping.

**Digital Art**: Procreate on iPad for digital drawing and sketching.

**3D Modeling**: Blender for 3D art and modeling projects.

## Productivity

**Notes**: I currently use Craft for knowledge management with the Zettelkasten method.

**Window Management**: I use a tiling window manager (yabai) - once you go tiling, you can't go back.

**File Management**: Finder with some customizations, and fd/fzf for command-line file operations.

## Utilities

**Search**: I use grep extensively for searching through my notes and codebase.

**Fonts**: Berkeley Mono for coding, Zodiak for display text, and SF Pro for UI elements.

**Browser**: Safari for daily browsing, Firefox for development testing.

## Hardware

**Main Machine**: 13" M3 MacBook Air - perfect balance of performance and portability.

**Peripherals**: Custom mechanical keyboard with linear switches, and I'm experimenting with the Semimak layout.

The beauty of Nix is that most of this configuration is declarative and reproducible across machines.
