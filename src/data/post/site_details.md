I care about the details very much. This site has gone through many iterations, and each version has been a learning experience.

## Technical Details

This version of the site is built with a custom static site generator called [Simple](https://github.com/tnixc/simple) that I wrote in Rust. It features:

- Component-based HTML inlining
- Bi-directional editing capabilities
- Markdown processing
- Custom templating system

## Design Philosophy

I believe in clean, functional design that doesn't get in the way of content. The typography is carefully chosen, and I spend a lot of time on the micro-interactions and details that make the experience feel polished.

## Performance

The site is designed to be fast and lightweight. No unnecessary JavaScript, optimized assets, and clean HTML output.

## Future Plans

I'm always iterating on this site. Each version teaches me something new about web development, design, and what I want to express online.
