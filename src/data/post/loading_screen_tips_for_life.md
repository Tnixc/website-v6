Just because I know these things doesn’t mean I do them. I’ve read them in blog posts, tweets, and conversations with LLMs: take that how you will.

None of this is comprehensive or perfectly sourced. Some I’ve tried, some I’ve ignored, some I just believe. If you want to add sources, message me. I try to be aware of my own biases and trusts in data, but finding good sources is really hard.

I suggest actually thinking about your life on a longer time scale once in a while, because, even if you think so right now, you are probably _not_ gonna kill yourself.

## People

Almost everything in life revolves around people. Relationships are one of the main pillars of life.

- Find your people: the ones you actually belong to. It takes time, but it’s worth everything. I **highly** suggest reading [Loneliness: The Four Circles of Belonging](https://boxx.substack.com/p/loneliness-the-four-circles-of-belonging)
- Maintaining a friendship takes effort
- Meet people and get to know them: expand your network, a zero-downside activity
- **Notice that the people you treasure most will probably die before you**, be more present.
- Go to events regularly: I’ve been going to [HackerFab-Waterloo](https://www.waterloofab.com/), [Socratica](https://www.socratica.info/), Tea Club, and hopefully Claude Builder Club. Use [Luma](https://luma.com/) and Twitter/Facebook to find events
- If you can be mentored, take it. If you can mentor, do it. It benefits both sides
- Reaching out is basically free: a cold DM or email could work
- “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity” - [Hanlon’s razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor)

## Actions

You only get one body for life.

#### Sleep

- **Sleep**: foundation of everything - free 20% improvement in QoL by sleeping from 10pm-7am every day.
  - Sleep 7–9 hours a night
  - Go to bed and wake up at consistent times
  - Use your bed for sleeping only (see [Spaceship You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3Ck))
  - Dark, cool room
  - Avoid caffeine late in the day
  - If you suspect sleep apnea, get it checked

#### Health

- Exercise daily: even a walk counts
- Go outside: sunlight regulates circadian rhythm and mood
- Eat to meet caloric goals, not until you feel “full”
- Floss daily and visit the dentist yearly
- Never smoke, vape, or use recreational drugs
- Alcohol: no safe dose, per [WHO](https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health). I get kind of upset when my parents drink because it reminds me that they are just gonna die sooner.
- 20-minute naps can restore alertness without grogginess, this is OP especially with caffeine
- Caffeine has positive effects on longevity

#### Mind

- Meditation
- Don’t speak when angry
- Journaling helps. Even if it doesn't, reflection and tracking patterns is interesting.
- Feel your emotions instead of suppressing them, this is pretty important
- Gratitude practice might not increase happiness ([Dynomight](https://dynomight.net/gratitude/)) but probably wouldn't hurt
- When anxious: imagine the worst-case scenario. It’s rarely catastrophic. This has also made me realize some actions are zero-cost

I've heard writing is good for you too. I'm not sure why, and I haven't been doing that much, but yeah?

#### Your time

Finally, and most importantly your time. Every time you do something, just think of the opportunity cost. If I play a video game for an hour that's 4% of my day that I could have spent learning something new.

If you don't have anything to do, you **will** waste your time. This is incredibly difficult not to do. Try anyway.

## Mindset

I believe in grindmaxxing.

- Consistency >> rare intensity
- Accountability partners
- Cognitive reappraisal (reframing how you interpret events) reduces stress
- Don't chase perfection
- "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems." - James Clear

#### Skill

- Learning to learn is probably the most important thing you can do
- Be willing to take on projects that surpass your current skillset - this is one of the most effective ways for me to learn (personally)

## Reading

Reading is better for your attention than short-form content. I’ve been getting back into reading.

- [Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/) and [Astral Codex Ten](https://www.astralcodexten.com/) - Scott Alexander’s writing
- [Dynomight](https://dynomight.net/) - data-driven, interesting studies, and tips
- [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/) - amazing and also hilarious
- [Near Blog](https://near.blog/) - incredible reading list and other tips. If you are going to read one of these read this.

If you have any book recommendations let me know.

## Meta

If something helps you live better, keep it. If not, discard it.
